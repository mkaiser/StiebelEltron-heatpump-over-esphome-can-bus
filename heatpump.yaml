# this file is to configure Home Assistant to work with the ESPHome heatpump CAN sensor
# 1. copy this file to %HA-CONFIG_ROOT%/packages/heatpump/heatpump.yaml
# 2. edit %HA-CONFIG_ROOT%/configuration.yaml and include the heatpump.yaml by adding following below "homeassistant:", e.g.:
#homeassistant:
#  packages:
#    heatpump: !include packages/heatpump/heatpump.yaml
